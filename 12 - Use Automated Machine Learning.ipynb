    "# Use Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of machine learning algorithm that you can use to train a model, and sometimes it's not easy to determine the most effective algorithm for your particular data and prediction requirements. Additionally, you can significantly affect the predictive performance of a model by preprocessing the training data, using techniques such as normalization, missing feature imputation, and others. In your quest to find the *best* model for your requirements, you may need to try many combinations of algorithms and preprocessing transformations; which takes a lot of time and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning enables you to automate the comparison of models trained using different algorithms and preprocessing options. You can use the visual interface in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml/azure.com) or the SDK to leverage this capability. The SDK gives you greater control over the settings for the automated machine learning experiment, but the visual interface is easier to use.\n",

    "In addition to the latest version of the **azureml-sdk** and **azureml-widgets** packages, you'll need the **azureml-train-automl** package to run the code in this notebook. Run the cell below to verify that it is installed."
